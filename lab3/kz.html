                    happened since the last edition.

                            <p>Justin, who runs our Wednesday evening classes, is thinking of holding a <b>wine
                                    tasting.</b>
                                He
                                promises to prepare some <i>petit fours</i> (whatever they are — we assume they're
                                French)
                                to
                                accompany <i>le vin</i> (also French). Let us know if you'd be interested in attending.

                            <h4>Pregnant</h4>
                            <p>Marie, who helps Justin run the Wednesday evening classes, is either <b>pregnant</b> or

                                planned

                                week of dinners at each others' houses — a kind of do-it-yourself version of the TV
                                series <em>Come Dine With Me.</em> What a great idea! Unfortunately, the dinners were
                                abandoned
                                mid-week when all four friends contracted <i>Salmonella enterocolitis</i> from

                <h2>This Month's Recipe: Vegetarian Stew</h2>
                <p>
                    This month's recipe has been sent in by Colonel Ray Ling from Clonmel. He writes: “This
                    was a great favourite among the boys of my command when we were stationed in the
                    foothills of the Transdanubian Mountains in Hungary. The locals refer to it as <i>pörkölt,</i> but
                    we
                    just called it stew. It's deliciously warming and only 500 calories.” It sounds great, Ray! Ye
                    all let us know how you get on with it.

                            Two fresh vegetarians. Plump ones are best, but if you can't get plump, use three skinny
                            ones instead.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A cushion
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Three litres of <i>Zwack.</i>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Skin the vegetarians. Muffle any screams with the cushion.
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                <li>Dice the vegetarians into the bucket;</li>
                                <li>Leave overnight, somewhere away from the cat.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Heat down your pants for 40 minutes.

                    <p>Garnish with a sprig of something spriggy and a little grated badger.</p>
