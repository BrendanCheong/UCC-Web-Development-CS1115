                    It's Autumn already. We're all well-rested from our Summer vacations, and ready for a new

                    happened since the last edition.

                                promises to prepare some <i>petit fours</i> (whatever they are — we assume they're
                                French)
                                to
                                accompany <i>le vin</i> (also French). Let us know if you'd be interested in attending.

                                week of dinners at each others' houses — a kind of do-it-yourself version of the TV
                                series <i>Come Dine With Me.</i> What a great idea! Unfortunately, the dinners were
                                abandoned
                                mid-week when all four friends contracted <i>Salmonella enterocolitis</i> from

                <h1>This Month's Recipe: Vegetarian Stew</h1>
                <p>
                    This month's recipe has been sent in by Colonel Ray Ling from Clonmel. He writes: “This 
was a great favourite among the boys of my command when we were stationed in the 
foothills of the Transdanubian Mountains in Hungary. The locals refer to it as <i>pörkölt,</i> but we 
just called it stew. It's deliciously warming and only 500 calories.” It sounds great, Ray! Ye 
all let us know how you get on with it.
